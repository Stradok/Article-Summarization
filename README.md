Project Title: PubMed Summarization using BART and GPT-3
Overview
This project aims to demonstrate text summarization techniques using two different models:

BART (Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformers): A transformer model specifically designed for sequence-to-sequence tasks, including text summarization.
GPT-3 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3): A large-scale autoregressive language model capable of generating human-like text based on prompts.
Project Components
Data Loading and Preprocessing

Load the PubMed dataset using the datasets library and split it into training, testing, and validation sets.
Preprocess the text by converting to lowercase, removing special characters, digits, and unnecessary whitespace.
Model Preparation and Tokenization

BART Model:

Load the facebook/bart-large-cnn model and tokenizer from Hugging Face's Transformers library.
Define a tokenization function for BART to prepare inputs and labels suitable for sequence-to-sequence tasks.
GPT-3 Model:

Utilize the OpenAI API to interact with GPT-3 for generating text summaries based on input prompts.
Flask Web Application

Set up a Flask application to create a user-friendly interface for text summarization:
Create an HTML template (index.html) for inputting text and displaying summaries.
Implement routes in Flask (/ for homepage and /summarize for summarization endpoint).
Integrate BART for text summarization within the Flask application.
Deployment on Google Colab

Use flask-ngrok to expose the Flask application running on Google Colab to a public URL.
Ensure static assets like images (e.g., background image) are properly integrated with the Flask application.
Example and Testing

Provide examples of how to use both BART and GPT-3 for text summarization:
Generate summaries for sample articles from the PubMed dataset.
Display original text and generated summaries for comparison.
Documentation and Usage

Document step-by-step instructions for running the project:
Setup requirements (libraries, dependencies).
Running the Flask application on Google Colab and accessing the deployed URL.
Explaining how to input text and obtain summaries using the provided interface.
Future Improvements
Enhance summarization capabilities by fine-tuning BART on specific domains or tasks within the biomedical field.
Explore more advanced interaction with GPT-3, such as parameter tuning for better text generation results.
Optimize the Flask application for responsiveness and additional features (e.g., error handling, input validation).
Conclusion
This project combines powerful NLP models (BART and GPT-3) with a user-friendly web interface (Flask) to demonstrate effective text summarization techniques using PubMed articles. By leveraging pre-trained models and web technologies, it showcases practical applications in the field of biomedical research and natural language processing.
